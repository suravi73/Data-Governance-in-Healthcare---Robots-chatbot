### Fundamentals : Data Governance for Healthcare Robots ðŸ¤–

This analysis focuses on a comprehensive data governance strategy for a large-scale, EU-supported research project developing healthcare robots. It addresses the challenges of federated learning, ethical frameworks (e.g., HRBAD), and compliance with stringent regulations like GDPR and the Medical Device Regulation (MDR).

**Key Topics:**
* **Federated Learning** for privacy-preserving AI training.
* **Regulatory Compliance** with GDPR and MDR.
* **Ethical Considerations** and the tensions between privacy, fairness, and security.
* Practical **Data Management** and governance implementation frameworks.

### Application : Privacy and Anonymization for AI Chatbots ðŸ”’

This case study presents a hands-on approach to anonymizing sensitive data used for healthcare chatbot training, using the "Medical Student Mental Health" dataset. It focuses on technical methods to mitigate the risks of re-identification.

**Key Topics:**
* **Anonymization Techniques:** Tokenization, generalization, suppression, **k-Anonymity**, and **l-Diversity**.
* Identification and management of **Quasi-Identifiers (QIs)**.
* **Legal Obligations under GDPR**, including the distinction between anonymous and pseudonymized data.
